# Contracts

This project is a static site with no backend services and no network API.

The contracts in this folder describe the **public interface** of the site:

- UI state shape (settings, selection)
- User interactions/events
- Invariants and precedence rules (e.g., highlight vs multiples coloring)

See [ui-contract.md](ui-contract.md).
