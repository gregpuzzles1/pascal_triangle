## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are the device breakpoint definitions and row caps specified as normative requirements (not only in Clarifications/Assumptions)? [Completeness, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements defined for how the UI responds to viewport category changes (row clamp + layout adaptation) in a way that is objectively verifiable? [Completeness, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for the initial/default rows on first visit, including when a user has previously changed the slider? [Gap, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-004/FR-005]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for the row slider behavior at boundaries (min=1, max=device cap) including step size and labeling/feedback? [Gap, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK005 Are requirements defined for the “upper-left control area” (placement, grouping, ordering) with measurable layout rules? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-004a, Spec §FR-021]
- [ ] CHK006 Are requirements defined for the Reset control’s placement rule (anchoring and offsets relative to triangle container) beyond “above and to the right”? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK007 Are requirements defined for whether the Reset control clears selection state in addition to path highlights (and is this consistent across the spec)? [Conflict, Spec §US2 Acceptance 5, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK008 Are requirements defined for the selection model (single selection only vs multi-select) and how new selections replace prior highlights? [Completeness, Spec §US2 Acceptance 1–3, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK009 Are requirements defined for the activation gesture(s) used to trigger “single-select” and “double-select” across input types (mouse/touch), including any timing thresholds? [Gap, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-007/FR-009]
- [ ] CHK010 Are requirements defined for the conditions where two paths are “supported” and for how edge cells are detected/handled? [Completeness, Spec §US2 Acceptance 4, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK011 Are requirements defined for what happens if a “double-select” is attempted where only one path is valid (explicitly a no-op for the second path)? [Completeness, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK012 Are requirements defined for the exact set of cells included in each highlight path for a given selected cell, including boundary/degenerate cases? [Ambiguity, Spec §US2 Definition of “path”, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK013 Are requirements defined for the highlight path appearance (colors, fill vs outline, stroke width) and whether the selected cell is styled differently from the handle? [Gap, Spec §US2 Acceptance 1–2, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK014 Are requirements defined for highlight precedence relative to other visual states (multiples coloring, hover/focus/selected) as a single documented precedence order? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-016a]
- [ ] CHK015 Are requirements defined for interaction behavior when “Show numbers” is disabled (selection remains possible and highlight remains visible without numeric text)? [Completeness, Spec §US3 Acceptance 2, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-012]
- [ ] CHK016 Are requirements defined for interaction behavior when “Show hexes” is disabled (hit target definition and consistent geometry)? [Gap, Spec §US3 Acceptance 3, Spec §FR-013]
- [ ] CHK017 Are requirements defined for the multiples-of-n toggle and n-slider presentation (when shown/hidden, labeling, feedback) beyond the numeric range rule? [Gap, Spec §FR-014/FR-015]
- [ ] CHK018 Are requirements defined for how multiples are visually distinguished (palette/legend/intensity) in a way that can be objectively assessed? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-016]
- [ ] CHK019 Are requirements defined for theme behavior (default light, toggle placement, persistence expectations) beyond “default to light”? [Gap, Spec §FR-011a]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK020 Is “sleek, modern layout” expressed as measurable design constraints (spacing scale, typography rules, consistent component sizing)? [Ambiguity, Spec §Input]
- [ ] CHK021 Is “hexagon-shaped container” defined precisely enough to avoid multiple valid implementations (filled vs outline, point orientation, gap rules)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK022 Is “text MUST fit within its hexagon container” clarified with concrete overflow rules (shrink-to-fit vs wrap vs truncate) and minimum legibility constraints? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK023 Are “distinct colors” for the two highlight paths specified with constraints that avoid inaccessible combinations (contrast thresholds, color-blind safe choices)? [Gap, Spec §US2 Acceptance 1–2]
- [ ] CHK024 Is “visually distinguished” for multiples-of-n clarified so the difference is not subjective (exact styling tokens)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-016]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK025 Do the Clarifications and Requirements align on breakpoints and max rows without contradictions or duplicated sources of truth? [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK026 Are the “single-select shows above-right” and “double-select adds above-left” rules consistent between Clarifications, US2 definition, and FR-008/FR-009? [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §US2 Definition of “path”, Spec §FR-008/FR-009]
- [ ] CHK027 Are the control placement requirements consistent across US1/US3 scenarios and FR-004a/FR-021 (single row slider, all primary controls upper-left)? [Consistency, Spec §US1 Acceptance 3, Spec §US3 Acceptance 6, Spec §FR-004a, Spec §FR-021]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK028 Are the acceptance scenarios for highlighting measurable without subjective terms (“distinct”, “clearly visible”) or are those terms explicitly quantified? [Clarity, Spec §US2 Acceptance 1–2, Spec §US3 Acceptance 5]
- [ ] CHK029 Is there clear traceability from each highlighting/controls requirement to at least one acceptance scenario and at least one success criterion? [Traceability, Spec §US1–US3, Spec §FR-004–FR-016a, Spec §SC-001–SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK030 Are requirements defined for near-top selections (rows 1–2) where paths may be trivial, and is expected behavior explicitly documented? [Gap, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK031 Are requirements defined for rapid successive selection changes and how highlight transitions should behave (instant vs animated vs unspecified)? [Gap, Spec §US2 Acceptance 3]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK032 Are requirements defined for extremely large values in lower rows (digit count growth) and the resulting layout/typography constraints? [Gap, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK033 Are requirements defined for small-screen control panel overflow/wrapping so controls remain usable at mobile widths? [Gap, Spec §FR-021]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK034 Are accessibility requirements explicitly specified for interactive elements (keyboard support, focus visibility, screen reader labeling, reduced-motion) rather than implied? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK035 Are performance expectations stated in the spec for interactions at the maximum row count (15) and during rapid slider changes? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases, Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK036 Are requirements defined for browser compatibility and fallback behavior for hex rendering (e.g., if advanced CSS shape support is limited)? [Gap, Spec §FR-002]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK037 Are assumptions about theme persistence (e.g., local preference storage) explicitly declared as requirements or explicitly excluded? [Assumption, Spec §FR-011a, Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK038 Are “How to use” requirements specific enough to ensure users can learn the selection/activation model and the precedence rules from on-page guidance? [Completeness, Spec §FR-017, Spec §SC-004]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK039 Is the mathematical “hockey stick” definition reconciled with an algorithmically unique cell set (so there is only one correct path per direction for any selected cell)? [Ambiguity, Spec §US2 Definition of “path”, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK040 Are styling precedence rules complete across all relevant visual systems (theme, hex visibility, numbers visibility, multiples, highlight, selected state) with no missing combinations? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-012–FR-016a]
