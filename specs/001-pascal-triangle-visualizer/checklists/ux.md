# UX Requirements Quality Checklist: Pascal’s Triangle Visualization Website

**Purpose**: Validate that UX/interaction requirements are complete, unambiguous, consistent, and objectively verifiable before implementation.
**Created**: 2026-02-01
**Feature**: ../spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.
**Assumed defaults**: Audience=PR reviewer, Depth=Standard, Focus=Balanced (UX + key non-functional + content/footer).

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are the initial/default row count requirements explicitly stated (including when viewport changes)? [Gap, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-004/FR-005]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements defined for viewport resize behavior (clamping + reflow) beyond the single Edge Case bullet? [Completeness, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK003 Are the interaction definitions for “single-select” and “double-select” fully specified for both mouse and touch (timing thresholds, tolerance, and accessibility alternative)? [Gap, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-007/FR-009]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for how selection state is visually represented (selected cell emphasis), separate from path highlighting? [Gap, Spec §US2 Acceptance 5, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK005 Are requirements defined for what happens when “Show numbers” is off regarding cell hit-targets and discoverability of selection? [Completeness, Spec §US3 Acceptance 2, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-012]
- [ ] CHK006 Are requirements defined for what happens when “Show hexes” is off regarding cell boundaries/targets and overall layout stability? [Completeness, Spec §US3 Acceptance 3, Spec §FR-013]
- [ ] CHK007 Are requirements defined for the control panel contents and ordering (theme toggle, row slider, checkboxes, n-slider) beyond “available in upper-left”? [Gap, Spec §FR-021]
- [ ] CHK008 Are requirements defined for the Reset control labeling (“Reset”, “Reset highlights”, etc.) and whether it is disabled/hidden when no selection exists? [Gap, Spec §FR-006, Spec §US2 Acceptance 5]
- [ ] CHK009 Are requirements defined for whether activation outside the triangle clears selection/highlights (and if not, is it explicitly excluded)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK010 Are requirements defined for the “How to use” section content scope (which controls/interactions must be described) and minimum specificity? [Gap, Spec §FR-017, Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK011 Are requirements defined for the educational text topics/claims (2–3 paragraphs) so content is non-arbitrary and reviewable? [Gap, Spec §FR-018]
- [ ] CHK012 Are requirements defined for footer link targets/URLs (license, repo, new issue), not just labels? [Gap, Spec §FR-019]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK013 Is “sleek, modern layout” translated into concrete, measurable UI requirements (spacing, typography, color contrast, visual hierarchy)? [Ambiguity, Spec §Input]
- [ ] CHK014 Is “hexagon-shaped container” precisely defined (filled vs outline, corner radius/flat sides, spacing rules) to avoid multiple interpretations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK015 Is “text MUST fit within its hexagon container” quantified (minimum font size, wrapping rules, truncation rules, max digits) at max rows? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK016 Is the “upper-left control area” defined in measurable terms (padding, max width, alignment relative to triangle) to make layout verifiable? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-004a, Spec §FR-021]
- [ ] CHK017 Is “above and to the right of the triangle” for Reset defined with a concrete placement rule (e.g., anchored to triangle container corner with offsets)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK018 Is “visually distinguish” for multiples-of-n specified with defined styling attributes and legend/meaning (color palette, intensity, accessibility)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-016]
- [ ] CHK019 Is the highlight styling defined sufficiently (colors, priority, stroke/fill, and how it appears when numbers/hexes are hidden)? [Gap, Spec §FR-007/FR-016a, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK020 Are the device breakpoints and max rows presented as normative requirements (not only in Clarifications/Assumptions) with a single source of truth section? [Clarity, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §FR-005]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK021 Do requirements and assumptions align on initial/default rows (Assumptions say default to device max; is this consistent with acceptance criteria and FRs)? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §SC-001, Spec §FR-004/FR-005]
- [ ] CHK022 Are “Reset clears highlights and selection state” requirements consistent between US2 scenarios and FR-006 wording (highlights only vs highlights+selection)? [Conflict, Spec §US2 Acceptance 5, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK023 Are “controls grouped upper-left” requirements consistent across US1/US3 scenarios and FR-004a/FR-021 (no duplicate slider; all controls included)? [Consistency, Spec §US1 Acceptance 3, Spec §US3 Acceptance 6, Spec §FR-004a, Spec §FR-021]
- [ ] CHK024 Are “Show hexes” and “Show numbers” requirements consistent about preserving interactivity and layout stability when hidden? [Consistency, Spec §US3 Acceptance 2–3, Spec §FR-012/FR-013]
- [ ] CHK025 Are the highlight path definitions consistent across prose definition, FR-011, and the single-select/double-select defaults? [Consistency, Spec §US2 Definition of “path”, Spec §FR-008/FR-009/FR-011]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK026 Are success criteria objectively measurable without subjective judgment (e.g., “identify and use” in SC-004 has measurable proxies)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK027 Do acceptance scenarios include enough precision to be unambiguous (e.g., “clean, modern layout”, “distinct color”, “clearly visible”)? [Clarity, Spec §US2 Acceptance 1–2, Spec §US3 Acceptance 5]
- [ ] CHK028 Are acceptance scenarios traceable to functional requirements (each scenario maps to at least one FR, and each FR is covered by at least one scenario)? [Traceability, Spec §US1–US3, Spec §FR-001–FR-021]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK029 Are primary flows specified end-to-end: set rows → select cell → see path(s) → reset → adjust toggles (numbers/hexes/multiples) without ambiguity? [Coverage, Spec §US1–US3]
- [ ] CHK030 Are alternate flows specified for edge cells and near-top rows (where one or both paths may degenerate) with clear rules? [Coverage, Spec §US2 Acceptance 4, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK031 Are exception/error scenarios specified for unsupported interactions (e.g., double-activation gesture not recognized) and for minimum/maximum slider positions? [Gap, Spec §FR-004/FR-009]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK032 Are requirements defined for rapid slider movement and intermediate states (debounce/animation expectations or explicit “instant update”) to avoid ambiguous UX? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK033 Are requirements defined for multiples coloring at n=1 and n=R, including whether any legend/help explains this behavior? [Completeness, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-015/FR-016]
- [ ] CHK034 Are requirements defined for content overflow on small screens (control panel wrapping, triangle horizontal scrolling vs scaling)? [Gap, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-021]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK035 Are accessibility requirements specified (keyboard navigation, focus states, reduced motion, color contrast, screen reader labels for controls)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK036 Are performance requirements specified in the spec (not only in the plan), including target responsiveness at max rows? [Gap, Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK037 Are cross-browser support assumptions specified (e.g., CSS `clip-path` support for hexes) and is there a fallback requirement? [Gap, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK038 Are theme requirements fully specified (persistence rules, system preference interaction, and minimum contrast in both themes)? [Gap, Spec §FR-011a]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK039 Are deployment/hosting assumptions (GitHub Pages base path, Actions from `main` only) reflected as explicit constraints in the spec requirements if they affect UX (routing, asset paths)? [Assumption, Plan §Summary]
- [ ] CHK040 Are external link assumptions documented (license URL, repo URL, issue URL) so footer requirements are implementable without guesswork? [Dependency, Spec §FR-019]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK041 Is the “hockey stick” path computation specified with enough precision to produce a single correct set of highlighted cells for any selected cell (including boundaries)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK042 Is color precedence fully specified across states (highlight vs multiples vs hover/focus/selected), and is there a single precedence order documented? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-016a]
