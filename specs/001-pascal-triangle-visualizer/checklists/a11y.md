# Accessibility Requirements Quality Checklist: Pascal’s Triangle Visualization Website

**Purpose**: Validate that accessibility requirements are complete, unambiguous, consistent, and objectively verifiable (keyboard, screen reader, contrast, motion, touch targets, and responsive behavior).
**Created**: 2026-02-01
**Feature**: ../spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are accessibility requirements explicitly included as first-class requirements (not implied), with a clear scope statement? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK002 Are keyboard interaction requirements specified for all interactive controls (theme toggle, row slider, checkboxes, n-slider, Reset)? [Gap, Spec §FR-004/FR-006/FR-011a/FR-012/FR-013/FR-014/FR-015]
- [ ] CHK003 Are keyboard interaction requirements specified for triangle cell selection and for the “double-select” secondary-path intent (or an accessible alternative)? [Gap, Spec §FR-007/FR-009]
- [ ] CHK004 Are focus management requirements specified (initial focus, focus order, and focus retention when rows change or toggles are used)? [Gap, Spec §FR-004/FR-021]
- [ ] CHK005 Are focus visibility requirements specified for all interactive elements (minimum focus indicator contrast/size)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK006 Are screen reader labeling requirements specified for all controls (including the meaning of sliders and toggle states)? [Gap, Spec §FR-004/FR-012/FR-013/FR-014/FR-015]
- [ ] CHK007 Are requirements specified for announcing selection/highlight state changes (selected cell, path A vs path B) to assistive technologies? [Gap, Spec §FR-007/FR-009]
- [ ] CHK008 Are requirements specified for the semantic structure of content sections (“How to use”, properties text, footer) to support navigation by headings/landmarks? [Gap, Spec §FR-017/FR-018/FR-019]
- [ ] CHK009 Are requirements specified for minimum touch target sizes and spacing for controls and triangle cells on mobile? [Gap, Spec §FR-005/FR-021]
- [ ] CHK010 Are requirements specified for error prevention and recovery for controls that can change state quickly (row slider, n-slider), such as describing the current value and bounds? [Gap, Spec §FR-004/FR-015]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK011 Are contrast requirements defined for text, hex outlines, and highlights in both light and dark themes (including when numbers are hidden)? [Gap, Spec §FR-003/FR-011a/FR-012/FR-013]
- [ ] CHK012 Are “distinct colors” for the two highlight paths constrained so users who cannot perceive color differences still have a perceivable distinction (pattern/outline/shape)? [Gap, Spec §US2 Acceptance 1–2, Spec §FR-007/FR-009]
- [ ] CHK013 Is the precedence of highlight styling over multiples coloring defined in a way that remains perceivable under different vision conditions (color-blindness, low contrast)? [Gap, Spec §FR-016a]
- [ ] CHK014 Are requirements defined for how hidden numbers/hexes affect accessible names/descriptions (e.g., whether values remain available to assistive tech)? [Gap, Spec §FR-012/FR-013]
- [ ] CHK015 Are requirements defined for motion/animation usage (if any) and reduced-motion behavior? [Gap]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK016 Are interaction requirements consistent between the “double-select” assumption and accessibility needs (alternate input methods) without introducing conflicting rules? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK017 Do requirements remain consistent about interactivity when numbers/hexes are hidden (visual vs non-visual affordances) across US3 and FR-012/FR-013? [Consistency, Spec §US3 Acceptance 2–3, Spec §FR-012/FR-013]
- [ ] CHK018 Are responsive row caps and layout constraints consistent with touch target requirements (e.g., 10 rows on mobile still supports minimum target sizes)? [Conflict, Spec §FR-005]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK019 Are accessibility-related acceptance criteria included (keyboard-only operation, non-color-dependent highlighting, readable contrast) and written as measurable requirements? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK020 Are “How to use” success criteria written so they include accessibility considerations (e.g., guidance usable with assistive technologies)? [Gap, Spec §SC-004, Spec §FR-017]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK021 Are requirements specified for keyboard-only usage across primary scenarios (set rows, select cell, show one/two paths, reset, toggle settings)? [Gap, Spec §US1–US3]
- [ ] CHK022 Are requirements specified for screen reader-only usage across primary scenarios (discover controls, understand current row count, understand selected cell/highlights)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK023 Are requirements specified for users who cannot perform a double-gesture (motor/accessibility) to still access the “second path” behavior? [Gap, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK024 Are requirements specified for users who cannot perceive color differences (non-color cues, legend/description)? [Gap, Spec §FR-007/FR-009/FR-016]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK025 Are requirements defined for accessible behavior on viewport resize (focus retention, announcements, and clamping communication) when row count is reduced? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK026 Are requirements defined for large number readability (font scaling rules) without breaking layout at max rows? [Gap, Spec §FR-003/FR-005]
- [ ] CHK027 Are requirements defined for when multiples coloring is enabled with n=1 (perceivability without overwhelming the UI)? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-016]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK028 Is conformance level or accessibility standard specified (e.g., WCAG target level) or explicitly out of scope? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK029 Are localization/number formatting accessibility considerations specified (digit grouping, reading order) or explicitly excluded? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK030 Are assumptions about using color and shape (hex clip-path) reconciled with accessibility needs and fallback requirements? [Gap, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK031 Are assumptions about device categories and touch interaction reconciled with accessibility requirements for assistive tech on mobile? [Assumption, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §FR-005]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK032 Are there any ambiguous terms that impact accessibility (“sleek”, “clean”, “clearly visible”) and are they translated into measurable accessibility-relevant constraints? [Ambiguity, Spec §Input, Spec §US2 Acceptance 1–2]
- [ ] CHK033 Is there a single, unambiguous definition of “selected” vs “highlighted” state and how each is communicated non-visually? [Gap, Spec §US2 Acceptance 5, Spec §FR-007]
